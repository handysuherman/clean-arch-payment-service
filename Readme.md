# ðŸš€ Clean Architecture Payment Service

This project implements a payment service following Clean Architecture principles, ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability.

## Key Technologies

- **gRPC**: For efficient, low-latency communication between services.
- **Kafka**: Message broker for event-driven communication and distributed processing.
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust and scalable relational database.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and fast access to key-value data.
- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for configuration.
- **Consul**: Service discovery and configuration management.

## Deployment and CI/CD

- **Jenkins**: Used for CI/CD, automating the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- **Ansible**: Automation tool for configuration management and deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent and scalable application distribution.

## Features
